  Here is my class research project where I was tasked with creating an infographic, artifact and presentation on any subject. The course emphasized representing multimodality in writing, which influenced my decision to create a poster linking to my interactive infographic. I wanted to explore how to capture a readerâ€™s attention effectively. While my poster may appear dramatic, its purpose was to engage viewers and encourage them to explore my research further.

My presentation begins with an overview of AI, explaining how algorithms learn and how biases can emerge. It concludes with actionable steps that community members can take to address these biases. My research was inspired by computer scientist Dr. Joy Buolamwini and her powerful Netflix documentary Coded Bias, which highlights the critical ethical concerns surrounding AI and facial recognition.
