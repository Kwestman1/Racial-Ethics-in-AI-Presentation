  Here is my class research project where I was tasked with creating an infographic, artifact and presentation on any subject. The course was focused on representing multimodality in writing. 
  
  I chose to create a poster linking to my interactive infographic because I wanted to play with the idea of how to catch a readers attention. Although my poster might seem extreme it draws people in and invites them to read my research. 
  
  My presentation starts with a brief understanding of AI, how algorithm's learn and how might biases in AI arises, concluding with opportune actions that community members can participate in. My research was inspired from computer scientist Dr. Joy Buolamwini, and her impactful Netflix documentary 'Coded Bias'.
