This was a class research project where I was tasked with creating an infographic, artifact and presentation representing multimodality in writing.
I chose to create a poster linking to my interactive infographic to represent how people's attention gets caught. Although my poster might seem extreme it draws people in and hopefully 
invites them to read my research. My presentation starts with a brief understanding of AI, how algorithm's learn and how might bias AI arises, concluding with opportune actions that community members can participate in. My research
was inspired from computer scientist Dr. Joy Buolamwini, and her impactful documentary 'Coded Bias'.
